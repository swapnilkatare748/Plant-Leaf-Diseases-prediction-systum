          <h1>Abstract</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Accurately detecting disease occurrences of crops in early stage is essential for quality and yield of crops through the decision of an appropriate treatments. However, detection of disease needs specialized knowledge and long-term experiences in plant pathology. Thus, an automated system for disease detecting in crops will play an important role in agriculture by constructing early detection system of disease. To develop this system, construction of a stepwise disease detection model using images of diseased-healthy plant pairs and a CNN algorithm consisting of five pre-trained models. The disease detection model consists of three step classification models, crop classification, disease detection, and disease classification. The â€˜unknownâ€™ is added into categories to generalize the model for wide application. In the validation test, the disease detection model classified crops and disease types with high accuracy (97.09%). The low accuracy of non-model crops was improved by adding these crops to the training dataset implicating expendability of the model. Our model has the potential to apply to smart farming of Solanaceae crops and will be widely used by adding more various crops as training dataset.

          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <br />
          <p>Crop disease management is important in agriculture to increase yield and quality by reducing the economic and aesthetic damage caused by plant diseases. Although research into the causes and effective treatments for crop diseases is actively underway, monitoring plant health and early detection of pathogens are critical to reduce disease spread and facilitate effective management1. Detecting and protecting crops from pathogens is labor-intensive and time-consuming, making it virtually impossible for humans to analyze each plant2. Therefore, research on combining and applying new technologies to efficiently detect diseases has been conducted, and recently, research on detecting plant diseases in leaves using artificial intelligence (AI) is in progress3. Continued development of improved classification models, such as disease detection, or plant health monitoring, may enable AI-supported decision-making systems for smart agriculture4. Various studies have been carried out to apply deep learning algorithms more precisely to disease detection, such as applying newly developed architectures5,6, automatically detecting and classifying lesions in plant images7, or conducting research on preprocessing methods for incomplete images8 for practical use.</p>

          <h1>Dataset</h1>
          <p>The PlantVillage dataset is a large, publicly available dataset created to assist in the detection of plant diseases. It was originally developed as part of a project aimed at improving agricultural productivity by providing a tool for early disease diagnosis in crops. This dataset contains over 50,000 images of healthy and diseased plant leaves, covering 38 different plant classes, including crops like tomatoes, apples, corn, potatoes, and more.</p>
